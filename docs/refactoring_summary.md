# Random Intersection Graph Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the clubviz project to properly implement the Schelling and Voter models as described in the research paper "Schelling and Voter Model on Random Intersection Graph" by Maddalena Donà, Slavik Koval and Pieter Trapman.

## Major Architectural Changes

### 1. Mathematical Foundation Implementation

**Previous Issues:**
- Incorrect join probability formula (used `k/C` instead of `1/C`)
- Wrong leave probability calculation (threshold-based instead of proper formula)
- Simple club membership model instead of random intersection graph
- No voter model implementation
- No model selection capability

**New Implementation:**
- **Random Intersection Graph Structure**: Proper bipartite auxiliary graph with individual and group vertices
- **Schelling Model**: Edge creation rate `c/m` and deletion rate `β(aᵢ, k⁺ⱼ(t), k⁻ⱼ(t))` based on opinion agreement
- **Voter Model**: Opinion change dynamics based on social influence
- **Combined Model**: Both edge and opinion dynamics running simultaneously
- **Model Selection**: User can choose between Schelling Only, Voter Only, or Combined models

### 2. Core Architecture Restructure

#### Configuration System (`js/config.js`)
- **Added Model Types**: Enumeration for `SCHELLING_ONLY`, `VOTER_ONLY`, `COMBINED`
- **Mathematical Parameters**: 
  - Graph structure: `n` (people), `m` (groups), `λ` (connectivity)
  - Schelling: `c` (edge creation rate), g-function types and steepness
  - Voter: `γ` (opinion change rate), voter types
- **Validation System**: Parameter validation with error reporting
- **G-Function Library**: Linear, sigmoid, and threshold functions for Schelling dynamics

#### Person Model (`js/models/Person.js`)
- **Opinion System**: Replaced "traits" with proper opinions (+1, -1)
- **Graph Connections**: 
  - Group connections (auxiliary graph)
  - Individual connections (intersection graph)
- **Voter Dynamics**: Opinion change probability calculation
- **History Tracking**: Opinion and connection history for analysis
- **Influence Calculation**: Both individual-based and group-based voter influence

#### Group Model (`js/models/Club.js`)
- **Renamed to Group**: More appropriate for mathematical context
- **Opinion Tracking**: Counts and proportions of opinions within groups
- **Schelling Calculations**: Edge deletion rate based on opinion composition
- **Voter Influence**: Group-based influence calculation for members
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive group analysis and diversity metrics

### 3. Simulation Engine (`js/simulation/Simulator.js`)

**Complete Rewrite:**
- **Model-Specific Dynamics**: Separate execution paths for each model type
- **Proper Mathematical Implementation**: 
  - Schelling: `c/m` creation rate, `β` deletion function
  - Voter: `γ` opinion change rate with influence calculation
- **Convergence Detection**: Automatic detection of steady states
- **Statistics Collection**: Comprehensive turn-by-turn analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient edge and opinion updates

### 4. Graph Initialization (`js/simulation/GraphInitializer.js`)

**New Component:**
- **Random Graph Generation**: Proper Poisson-distributed connections
- **Weight Systems**: Support for uniform and exponential weight distributions
- **Initial Conditions**: Configurable opinion splits and group structures
- **Validation**: Graph property verification and statistical reporting
- **Mathematical Sampling**: Poisson, exponential, and normal distributions

### 5. User Interface Overhaul

#### HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- **Modern Layout**: Responsive design with proper accessibility
- **Model Selection**: Radio buttons for choosing simulation type
- **Parameter Controls**: Organized sections for different parameter types
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live display of key metrics
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern interface with proper information hierarchy

#### CSS Styling (`styles/main.css`)
- **Modern Design System**: Glass morphism effects with backdrop blur
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly design with proper breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: High contrast support and focus states
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation of different UI sections
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Gradient backgrounds and smooth animations

#### Dashboard Controller (`js/visualization/Dashboard.js`)
- **Model-Aware Controls**: Parameter visibility based on selected model
- **Validation Integration**: Real-time parameter validation with error display
- **Statistics Updates**: Live updating of convergence and segregation metrics
- **Visualizer Management**: Seamless switching between different visualization types

## Key Mathematical Improvements

### 1. Schelling Model Corrections
```javascript
// OLD (Incorrect)
joinProb = k / C  // Wrong formula
leaveProb = threshold-based logic  // Not from paper

// NEW (Correct)
edgeCreationRate = c / m  // From paper: rate c/m
edgeDeletionRate = β(aᵢ, k⁺ⱼ(t), k⁻ⱼ(t))  // Opinion-based deletion
```

### 2. Proper Graph Structure
```javascript
// OLD: Simple club membership
person.clubs = Set of clubs

// NEW: Random intersection graph
person.groups = Set of group vertices (auxiliary graph)
person.neighbors = Set of individual vertices (intersection graph)
// neighbors = all people sharing at least one group
```

### 3. Voter Model Implementation
```javascript
// NEW: Opinion change dynamics
opinionChangeProb = γ * oppositeInfluence
influence = calculateVoterInfluence(person, voterType)
// Supports both individual-based and group-based influence
```

## Documentation and Code Quality

## Future Extensibility

The refactored architecture provides clear extension points for:

1. **Additional Models**: Easy to add new dynamics (SIR, other opinion models)
2. **Graph Types**: Support for different network structures
3. **Visualizations**: Modular visualizer system for new display types
4. **Analysis Tools**: Framework for additional statistical measures
5. **Parameter Studies**: Systematic exploration of parameter space

## Performance Improvements

1. **Efficient Graph Updates**: O(1) membership operations
2. **Optimized Statistics**: Incremental calculations instead of full recomputation
3. **Smart Rendering**: Only update visualization when necessary
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management

## Conclusion

This refactoring transforms the project from a simple club membership simulation into a proper implementation of the mathematical models described in the research paper. The new architecture is:

- **Mathematically Correct**: Implements the exact formulas from the paper
- **Feature Complete**: Supports all three model variants (Schelling, Voter, Combined)
